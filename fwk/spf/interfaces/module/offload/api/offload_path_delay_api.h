/**
 * Parameter ID for getting path delay from Satellite APM
 *
 * The graphs corresponding to the modules mentioned in the
 * payload of this command must be opened using #APM_CMD_GRAPH_OPEN
 *
 * This param is used with APM_CMD_GET_CFG.
 * Usually APM_CMD_GET_CFG doesn't carry any parameter specific payload, however,
 * this command contains payload to specify the path.
 *
 * For the delay to be accurate calibration should already be done for the path.
 * Media format must have been propagated. Typically, all subgraphs must be in PREPARE state.
 *
 * Maximum possible delay from source to destination is returned.
 * In some cases, delay may not be exactly same as returned. For example, in FTRT paths, or
 * processing time is smaller than expected. Also, delay can be obtained only for PCM or packetized data paths.
 * If raw compressed data is involved, then delay cannot be known correctly for the portion that's compressed.
 * Query however, won't fail as delay of the rest of the path (if any) can be determined.
 *
 * Under split-merge scenarios, if there are multiple paths from source to destination,
 * first path will be chosen arbitrarily.
 *
 * If path is not complete, error is returned.
 * Delay is >= 0.
 *
 * Client can leave the port-ids zeros to be autofilled by spf.
 * When port-ids are zero src and dst module's delay may or may not be included as explained below
 *
 *  -  If src has only outputs and max input ports = 0, then it's delay is included.
 *       Since src has no input ports, this is the only way to account for its delay.
 *  -  If dst has only input ports and max output ports = 0, then it's delay is included.
 *       Since dst has no output ports, this is the only way to account for its delay.
 *  -  For all other cases, delay is from the output port of src to output port of dst.
 *       This way of defining helps in concatenation. E.g.,  A -> B -> C can be obtained as A to B + B to C
 *       and delay of B is not considered twice.
 *       When dst has multiple outputs, an output will be selected arbitrarily.
