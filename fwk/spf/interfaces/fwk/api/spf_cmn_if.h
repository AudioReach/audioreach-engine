/** @weakgroup weakf_spf_msg_overview
  The spf message structure is used throughout the spf framework for
  internal communication. A spf message contains an opcode and a pointer
  to a payload.

  All non-APR payloads begin with a common header structure, which includes
  fields for a return queue, response handle, destination handle, token,
  response result, payload size, and the start of the payload (to ensure the
  payload starts at an 8-byte aligned boundary). Many opcodes will require
  additional, specialized header fields: these can be defined in another
  header structure which can be placed in the common header's payload field.

  The opcodes are globally defined. The recommended way to process a spf
  message is to use a function table with each entry being the message handler
  corresponding to the opcode. To reduce the function table size, the number
  of opcodes is tightly limited.

  Handles are defined to provide an association between a port's data queue and
  its container's command queue. Each handle contains a pointer to a queue and
  a pointer to a command handle. The command handle contains a command
  queue and the a thread ID. This two-layered approach is used to avoid
  duplicate (and possibly outdated) copies of container information within the
  container's port handles.

  A handle may have a NULL command handle pointer if the handle does not
  correspond to a container. Similarly, a container may store its command
  queue in its own handle. Since this handle would not be tied to a port, the
  queue pointer can be NULL in this case.

  Internal messages can be sent through the command path (command queue) or
  data path (port's data queue). Message utility functions are provided to
  accomplish either using handles. Messages that should be sent through the
  data path include exchanges of data buffers as well as any notifications
  that must be synchronized with the data itself, including media format and
  eos messages. Other messages should be sent through the command path.

  As much as possible, command path messages should be sent to containers from
  APM. To maintain centralization, container to container messaging is
  discouraged.

  Many messages require a response in the form of an acknowledgement, an
  indication of success or failure, or possibly to provide more specialized
  information such as query results. The common behavior for a response is to
  push the same message header and payload to the response handle, modifying the
  response result as necessary. The sender will then receive the response,
  validate the token value to match the response to the sent message, and check
  the response result.

  If more customized responses are needed, other approaches are possible and
  can be handled with opcode-specific behavior.
