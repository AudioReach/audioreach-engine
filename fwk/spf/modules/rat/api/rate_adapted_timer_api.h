                                                 - MIMO RAT has one static input and one static output port. It has
   infinite dynamic input and output ports. \n
                                                 - It has a one to one mapping between input and output ports i.e. only
   one input corresponds to only one output \n
                                                 - Static output port needs mandatory media format config via
   PARAM_ID_RAT_MEDIA_FORMAT.\n
                                                 - As far as input data is concerned, it behaves as a pass through
   module.\n
                                                 - If input is not available, if the static output port of MIMO RAT is
   connected and started \n
                                                   and media format is configured, RAT will pump zeroes at the output.\n
                                                 - If input is not available, if dynamic output port of MIMO RAT is
   connected and started, \n
                                                   it will not send any output until input media format is received.
   Once input media format \n
                                                   is received, it will send silence data with this format if there is
   no input available. \n
                          - RAT can only support one family of rates - either ineger or fractional.
                          - If mandatory static port config has integer sample rate then all ports must be integer
   family of rates.

                                 - Supports following params: \n
